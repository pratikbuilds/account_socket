# Rust WebSocket Server for Solana Program Accounts with Yellowstone Geyser

## Project Overview
Building a high-performance Rust WebSocket server that leverages Yellowstone Geyser plugin to monitor Solana program account updates in real-time, with parsing, caching, and database persistence capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Services
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time client connections and data broadcasting
- **Geyser Client**: High-performance account update streaming via Yellowstone Geyser
- **Account Parser**: Intelligent parsing of account data based on program types
- **Cache Layer**: Redis-based caching for performance optimization
- **Database Layer**: Persistent storage with efficient querying
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration system

   - Environment-based configuration
   - Database connection settings
   - Geyser endpoint configuration
   - WebSocket server settings

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
3. **Database Setup**
   - Define data models for account storage
   - Create database migrations
   - Implement connection pooling

4. **Cache Layer Implementation**
   - Redis connection setup
   - Cache management strategies
   - Performance optimization patterns

### Phase 3: Geyser Integration
5. **Yellowstone Geyser Client**
   - gRPC client setup and configuration
   - Account subscription logic
   - Error handling and reconnection

6. **Account Filtering & Parsing**
   - Program-specific account filters
   - Account data parsing logic
   - Data transformation pipelines

### Phase 4: WebSocket Server
7. **WebSocket Implementation**
   - Server setup with connection handling
   - Client authentication and management
   - Real-time message broadcasting

8. **Data Flow Integration**
   - Connect Geyser updates to WebSocket clients

## Key Technical Considerations

### Yellowstone Geyser Integration
- **High Throughput**: Geyser provides near real-time account updates with minimal latency
- **Filtering**: Implement efficient program-based filtering to reduce unnecessary data processing
- **Reconnection Logic**: Robust error handling for gRPC connection interruptions
- **Backpressure Handling**: Manage high-frequency updates without overwhelming downstream systems

### WebSocket Architecture
- **Connection Management**: Handle multiple concurrent client connections efficiently
- **Message Broadcasting**: Implement selective broadcasting based on client subscriptions
- **Authentication**: Secure client connections with appropriate authentication mechanisms

### Data Management
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (in-memory + Redis) for optimal performance
- **Database Design**: Efficient schema design for account data with proper indexing
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure consistency between cache, database, and real-time updates

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: Sub-100ms from Geyser update to WebSocket broadcast
- **Throughput**: Handle 1000+ account updates per second
- **Concurrent Connections**: Support 100+ simultaneous WebSocket clients
- **Resource Usage**: Efficient memory and CPU utilization

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end data flow testing
- **Load Testing**: Performance validation under high load
- **Mock Testing**: Geyser client testing with mock data

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation during partial failures
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error tracking and debugging

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Development, staging, and production configs
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of database credentials and API keys
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle features without code deployment

## Next Steps
1. Start with basic project setup and dependency configuration
2. Implement configuration management system
3. Set up database models and migrations
4. Begin Geyser client integration
5. Develop WebSocket server infrastructure
6. Integrate all components with comprehensive testing

This plan provides a solid foundation for building a production-ready Solana account monitoring system with real-time WebSocket capabilities.
